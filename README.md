# TO-DO APP
This is a simple todo app built with Svelte, Tailwind CSS, and Firebase. It allows users to add tasks to a list, mark tasks as complete, and remove tasks from the list. Users can also filter tasks by status (all, pending, completed) and by tag (work, study, read, write, draw, exercise, hobby, swimming).
